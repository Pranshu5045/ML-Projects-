# ML Projects
  ## The Gender Classification using voice dataset. 
  
  Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) is performed on the voice dataset which was downloaded from kaggle.

   Following 4 ML algorithms are used for classification task:
   
   (i) Kernel SVM
   
   (ii) Random Forest
  
   (iii) Decision Tree
 
   (iv) XgBoost
 
    Comparative analysis is performed after applying feature selection, dimensionality reduction, hyperparameter optimization and the best algorithm is determined based     on accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score.
    

  ## Possum Regression
  
  EDA is performed on the possum dataset available on kaggle.
   
   Following ML algorithms are used for the regression task:
   
   (i) Linear Regression
   
   (ii) Support Vector Regressor
   
    At the end, results are compared on the basis of different evaluation metrics. 
  
  
  ## Credit Card Fraud Detection
  
  The size of the creditcard dataset is increased using SMOTE oversampling and 100% accuracy is achieved using RandomForestClassifier and 95% with logistic Regression.
  
  The dataset can be downloaded using the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/download?datasetVersionNumber=3
  
  
  ## Heart Disease Prediction
  
  Following Exploratory Data Analysis of the dataset, Feature pipeline is applied to remove highly correlated features, constant/duplicate features and finally the       best hyperparameters are determined using GridSearch method to get the best accuracy.
  
  
  ## Diabetes Prediction using AutoML
  
  An example of how AutoML feature may be used to determine the best pipeline and algorithm for any classification Task.
  
  
  ## Association Mining on Online Retail Dataset
  
  Association mining is usually used to determine the association rules for items that are often bought together. It is used in marketing industry to determine which     items to be kept side by side in shops/malls.
